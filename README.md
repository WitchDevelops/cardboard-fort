# About
It's a pet project (pun intended) that is meant to help pet owners (both indivual, as well as biggers ones, like shelters) keep up-to-date with their pet's health, medication, and appointments. It can also be useful for easily sharing your pet's data (feeding schedule, etc.) with your pet sitter.
